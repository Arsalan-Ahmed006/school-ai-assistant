# ✨ Key Features

The School AI Assistant demonstrates the core concepts taught throughout Google's **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** by combining multiple specialized AI agents, grounded knowledge retrieval, secure tool execution, and production-ready backend architecture.

---

# 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of relying on one large chatbot, the application is built around a **specialized multi-agent architecture** using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

A central routing agent analyzes every incoming request before delegating it to the most appropriate specialist agent.

Current specialist agents include:

- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent FAQ Agent
- 👩‍🏫 Teacher Lesson Planning Agent

This modular architecture improves:

- Higher response accuracy
- Better maintainability
- Easier future expansion
- Stronger security boundaries
- Cleaner separation of responsibilities

---

# 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent FAQ Agent

The Parent FAQ Agent is responsible for answering common school-related questions using grounded school policy documents.

Example queries include:

- School timings
- Admission procedure
- Uniform policy
- Fee structure
- Attendance policy
- Examination schedule
- General school information

Instead of generating answers purely from the language model, the agent retrieves relevant information from school documents before responding.

This significantly reduces hallucinations while ensuring answers remain consistent with school policies.

---

# 👩‍🏫 Teacher Lesson Planning Agent

The Teacher Lesson Planning Agent assists teachers by automatically generating structured lesson plans using curriculum documents.

Capabilities include:

- Topic-based lesson planning
- Learning objectives
- Classroom activities
- Teaching methodology
- Assessment strategy
- Homework suggestions
- Learning outcomes

Rather than relying solely on Gemini's internal knowledge, lesson plans are grounded using curriculum resources retrieved through RAG.

---

# 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

To improve factual accuracy, the assistant uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Before Gemini generates a response, the relevant school documents are retrieved and supplied as context.

Benefits include:

- Grounded responses
- Reduced hallucinations
- School-specific information
- Higher factual accuracy
- More trustworthy educational responses

This allows the assistant to answer questions using the school's own documentation instead of relying exclusively on pretrained knowledge.

---

# 🛠 Tool Calling

The project demonstrates native **Tool Calling**, one of the core concepts covered during the Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive Course.

Specialized tools are invoked dynamically during execution, including:

- Knowledge Retrieval
- Prompt Validation
- Lesson Plan Formatting
- Response Formatting

Separating these responsibilities into reusable tools keeps the system modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

---

# 🛡 Security Guardrails

Security is enforced before any request reaches Gemini.

The assistant automatically detects and blocks:

- Prompt Injection
- Jailbreak Attempts
- Unsafe Instructions
- Irrelevant Requests
- Malicious Inputs

These layered security guardrails ensure that the assistant remains focused on educational tasks while protecting the underlying model from unsafe interactions.

---

# ⚡ Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

The School AI Assistant is powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

The model provides:

- Fast response generation
- Strong reasoning capabilities
- Reliable instruction following
- High-quality educational content
- Efficient tool orchestration

Gemini 2.5 Flash was selected because it offers an excellent balance between performance, reasoning quality, latency, and cost for production-ready educational assistants.

---

# 🚀 FastAPI Backend

The assistant is deployed through a **FastAPI** backend, making it easy to integrate with future web applications, mobile applications, or external services.

Benefits include:

- REST API support
- Streaming responses
- Production-ready deployment
- Easy frontend integration
- Scalable architecture

This separation between the backend API and the AI agents makes the project easier to extend and maintain in real-world deployments.

---
# 🏗️ System Architecture

The School AI Assistant follows a modular **multi-agent architecture** built with the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

Instead of relying on a single AI assistant, incoming requests are intelligently classified and routed to specialized agents responsible for different educational tasks.

This architecture improves scalability, maintainability, response quality, and security while demonstrating modern AI agent orchestration principles taught during the **Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive Course**.
